Program variants Generation Delta Ecor and Delta Java. By following the rules of Delta Oriented Programming in order to acheive Software Product Line (SPL).
- Delta Ecore, Delta Java
- Feature Oriented Sowafter Developmnent (FOSD)
- Delta Oriented Programming (DOP)
- Software Product Line Development
- Variants generation og  a graph library to acheive Graph Product Lines
- Graph is Undirected without configuring Directed and weighted 
- with Directed Graph will give directed Graph product 
- Graph will be Weighted with directed and undirected Edges if weighted has been checked in configuration 
- Graph Variation can be recieved as plain as Java project 
- Core has been changed by using lovely DeltaJava's operations e.g modifies, removes, adds and origional 
- Variants of Graph product line can be checked out using delta ecore.
